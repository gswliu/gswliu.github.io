### About me
In 2014, I received a BA in public health, with a concentration in Health Policy and Management, from University of California, Berkeley. I am now a second-year MPH student in Epidemiology, pursuing an Advanced Epidemiology certificate, at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.  

I believe that health systems strengthening and robust disease surveillance are crucial in efforts to relieve burdens of health issues, and strong local engagement in program implementation and robust outcome monitoring and reporting are key to program effectiveness and sustainability.  

On a personal level, I am a California native who enjoys watching and cheering for Bay Area sports teams, trying new foods and restaurants, and exploring a new-found love of yoga.

### Experience
I previously worked as a technical research analyst in Global Health Science at University of California, San Francisco. I have worked on a number of international projects related to HIV prevention, care, and treatment, as well as for an initiative addressing preterm birth in East Africa. I am primarily interested in “leakages” along the HIV care continuum; maternal, neonatal, and child health; health systems strengthening; and implementation science.
