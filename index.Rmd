### About
I received a BA in public health, with a concentration in Health Policy and Management, from University of California, Berkeley, in 2014. I am currently a second-year MPH student in Epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.  

I previously worked as a technical research analyst in Global Health Science at University of California, San Francisco, on a number of international projects related to HIV prevention, care, and treatment, as well as for an initiative addressing preterm birth in East Africa. I am primarily interested in “leakages” along the HIV care continuum; maternal, neonatal, and child health; health systems strengthening; and implementation science.
